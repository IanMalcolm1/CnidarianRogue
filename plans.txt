IMPORTANT:
In an effort to ever finish this thing it would probably be best to define some hard limits
on gameplay scope. The game loop should only consist of a single armor slot and a single
weapon slot without a proper inventory that would require me to make an new dedicated UI
screen. Stats should probably also be limited, though maybe there could be certain
consumables that increase them on pickup. No main menu.

TODOS:
Current:
Slightly better generation
   - Generation for the three floors
   - First rectangles (abandoned complex or inhabited cult), second caves, third bossfight
   - Power-up bushes and mushroom clusters in caves
   - Reduced number of intelligence mushrooms, more powerful items on later floors, healing
     items

Next:
Ability to choose name
Scrolling for look and playerui screens
   Maybe have a Scrollable class that gets passed text and spacing in the order I want rendered,
   coverts the text to formatted text, and tallies up the height of the entire thing. Probably
   should leave MessagesUI alone, though since that one is optimized for lots of messages that
   don't themselves change.

Maybe in free time:
Improve player-to-mouse path performance (A* implemenation)
Save functionality
   Change terrain tiles to proper entities beforehand if I do do it
Better generation (play around with perlin noise and things)
Look into lua

UI LAYOUT:
Openable (cover whole screen): Full Character Sheet, Inventory, Level Up Dialogues, Settings
Openable (small screen over map view): Use Ability, Take Items

MOVEMENT:
Ensure multiple creatures can't occupy same tile on same turn unless one is flying.

Friendly creatures switch places, otherwise a creature gets blocked when trying to move to a
tile where another exists. Probably disallow npcs moving the player character either, only
player character moving npcs. Otherwise high potential for bad gameplay experience.

Maybe eventually include movement cost modifiers.

AI WISHLIST
- Creatures can either be hostile, wary, or passive towards other creatures (including the
  player depending on alignments and threat levels).
- Creatures should retreat when their health percentage is low compared to that of their
  current assailant/would-be victim.
- Creatures should use weapon with highest dps when attacking, potentially modified by a
  'cowardice' stat or something that weights using ranged weapons over melee ones.
- Creatures should be able to use any abilities they have.

Wishfull Thinking (maybe add in a later game):
- Have tool-wielding creatures to simulate doing work at workstations, congregate in taverns
  or around campfires in the evening, go to sleep on beds/bedrolls at night.
- Have animals to go to their dens or lairs at different times depending on their circadian
  rhythms.
- Creatures meant to guard things have a chance to fall asleep on the job
- Support for house ownership
