IMPORTANT:
In an effort to ever finish this thing it would probably be best to define some hard limits
on gameplay scope. The game loop should only consist of a single armor slot and a single
weapon slot without a proper inventory that would require me to make an new dedicated UI
screen. Stats should probably also be limited, though maybe there could be certain
consumables that increase them on pickup. No main menu.

TODOS:
Current:
Make hydra spawning ability and ai

Slightly better generation
   - Generation for the three floors
   - First rectangles (abandoned complex or inhabited cult), second caves, third bossfight
   - Power-up fruit bushes and mushroom clusters in caves

   Cultists eat corpses (put something about "...rumors of corpse-eating cultists..." in a
   message upon level entry) and are symbiotes with Hydra clones (maybe they replace tongues?)

   Boss is hydra. Stationary but spawns clones every 3 turns.

Floor 1: Complete
Floor 2: Complete
Floor 3: In-Progress

Next:
Add flavor text on level changes
Add winning
Put player's health back at 18
Give character gender-neutral name
Figure out std::vector deallocation bug in LocalMap actors data member
   Probably trying to modify the actors array in LocalMap beyond bounds sometimes. Maybe remove
   direct actors[index] function and give the tilecoords one a bounds check
   Did above. Seems to be fixed.

Maybe in free time:
Improve player-to-mouse path performance (A* implemenation)
Move TurnQueue into Adventure. On switching scenes, remove all actors owned by the previous
 scene from the TurnQueue. The previous scene should save a snapshot of their turn times for
 when the player reenters a scene.
Save functionality
   Change terrain tiles to proper entities beforehand if I do do it
Better generation (play around with perlin noise and things)
Look into lua

UI LAYOUT:
Openable (cover whole screen): Full Character Sheet, Inventory, Level Up Dialogues, Settings
Openable (small screen over map view): Use Ability, Take Items

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
MOVEMENT:
Ensure multiple creatures can't occupy same tile on same turn unless one is flying.

Friendly creatures switch places, otherwise a creature gets blocked when trying to move to a
tile where another exists. Probably disallow npcs moving the player character either, only
player character moving npcs. Otherwise high potential for bad gameplay experience.

Differing movement costs based on terrain.

AI WISHLIST
- Creatures can either be hostile, wary, or passive towards other creatures (including the
  player depending on alignments and threat levels).
- Creatures should retreat when their health percentage is low compared to that of their
  current assailant/would-be victim.
- Creatures should use weapon with highest dps when attacking, potentially modified by a
  'cowardice' stat or something that weights using ranged weapons over melee ones.
- Creatures should be able to use any abilities they have.

Wishfull Thinking (maybe add in a later game):
- Have tool-wielding creatures to simulate doing work at workstations, congregate in taverns
  or around campfires in the evening, go to sleep on beds/bedrolls at night.
- Have animals to go to their dens or lairs at different times depending on their circadian
  rhythms.
- Creatures meant to guard things have a chance to fall asleep on the job
- Support for house ownership
