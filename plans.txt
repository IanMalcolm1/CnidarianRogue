IMPORTANT:
In an effort to ever finish this thing it would probably be best to define some hard limits
on gameplay scope. The game loop should only consist of a single armor slot and a single
weapon slot without a proper inventory that would require me to make an new dedicated UI
screen. Stats should probably also be limited, though maybe there could be certain
consumables that increase them on pickup. No main menu.

TODOS:
Current:
Add Abilities
   Cooldowns should be maintained between scenes. Either move TurnQueue into Adventure and
   remove all actors from scene being left behind (Scene would save snapshot of relevant
   actors and effects), or move Player and Player's effects between Scene TurnQueues. I
   prefer the first. It seems more extensible (can load scenes in and out like CoQ). TurnQueue
   nodes should include what scene they belong to.
Add press F to heal 10. 20 turn cooldown.
Reduce player max health

Slightly better generation
   - Generation for the three floors
   - First rectangles (abandoned complex or inhabited cult), second caves, third bossfight
   - Power-up fruit bushes and mushroom clusters in caves

Floor 1: Complete
Floor 2: In-Progress
Floor 3: Pending

Next:
Pre-Generate levels so there isn't a long pause at level 2?
Ability to choose name

Maybe in free time:
Improve player-to-mouse path performance (A* implemenation)
Save functionality
   Change terrain tiles to proper entities beforehand if I do do it
Better generation (play around with perlin noise and things)
Look into lua

UI LAYOUT:
Openable (cover whole screen): Full Character Sheet, Inventory, Level Up Dialogues, Settings
Openable (small screen over map view): Use Ability, Take Items

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
MOVEMENT:
Ensure multiple creatures can't occupy same tile on same turn unless one is flying.

Friendly creatures switch places, otherwise a creature gets blocked when trying to move to a
tile where another exists. Probably disallow npcs moving the player character either, only
player character moving npcs. Otherwise high potential for bad gameplay experience.

Maybe eventually include movement cost modifiers.

AI WISHLIST
- Creatures can either be hostile, wary, or passive towards other creatures (including the
  player depending on alignments and threat levels).
- Creatures should retreat when their health percentage is low compared to that of their
  current assailant/would-be victim.
- Creatures should use weapon with highest dps when attacking, potentially modified by a
  'cowardice' stat or something that weights using ranged weapons over melee ones.
- Creatures should be able to use any abilities they have.

Wishfull Thinking (maybe add in a later game):
- Have tool-wielding creatures to simulate doing work at workstations, congregate in taverns
  or around campfires in the evening, go to sleep on beds/bedrolls at night.
- Have animals to go to their dens or lairs at different times depending on their circadian
  rhythms.
- Creatures meant to guard things have a chance to fall asleep on the job
- Support for house ownership
