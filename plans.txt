IMPORTANT:
In an effort to ever finish this thing it would probably be best to define some hard limits
on gameplay scope. The game loop should only consist of a single armor slot and a single
weapon slot without a proper inventory that would require me to make an new dedicated UI
screen. Stats should probably also be limited, though maybe there could be certain
consumables that increase them on pickup. No main menu.

TODOS:
Current:
Rework TurnQueue
   Maybe make it an std::vector of nodes so that they aren't all just randomly allocated
   to the heap


Next:
Give effects descriptions somehow.
   Maybe just an enum that EffectManager can map to a name and description.
   The LookUI can do something like effectManager->getEffectDescription(Effect effect)
Keep track of effects in ActorEntities
   Actors will have vectors of pointers to effects that are stored in a pool by the
   EffectManager
Allow stacking certain effects
Make weapon stats show on Player and Look screens.
Let player attack enemies. Maybe I should have some sort of ActorUtils class to handle
   attacks and deaths and shit... Might help with effects
   in Scene
Stop auto move if player can see enemy
Add more creatures
Simple gameplay loop
Slightly better generation

Optional:
Save functionality (maybe in free time)
Better generation (play around with perlin noise and things)
Standardize UI screens
Look into lua

UI LAYOUT:
Openable (cover whole screen): Full Character Sheet, Inventory, Level Up Dialogues, Settings
Openable (small screen over map view): Use Ability, Take Items

MOVEMENT:
Ensure multiple creatures can't occupy same tile on same turn unless one is flying.

Friendly creatures switch places, otherwise a creature gets blocked when trying to move to a
tile where another exists. Probably disallow npcs moving the player character either, only
player character moving npcs. Otherwise high potential for bad gameplay experience.

Maybe eventually include movement cost modifiers.

AI
Necessary:
- Creatures can either be hostile, wary, or passive towards other creatures (including the
  player depending on alignments and threat levels).
- Creatures should retreat when their health percentage is low compared to that of their
  current assailant/would-be victim.
- Creatures should use weapon with highest dps when attacking, potentially modified by a
  'cowardice' stat or something that weights using ranged weapons over melee ones.
- Creatures should be able to use any abilities they have.

Superfluous (maybe add in a later game):
- Have tool-wielding creatures to simulate doing work at workstations, congregate in taverns
  or around campfires in the evening, go to sleep on beds/bedrolls at night.
- Have animals to go to their dens or lairs at different times depending on their circadian
  rhythms.
- Creatures meant to guard things have a chance to fall asleep on the job
- Support for house ownership

MODULAR AI
Part 1.) Have a set of core/basic states, like idle, sleeping, attacking, and fleeing.
Part 2.) Have component states that correspond to core states and have different weights.
		 When an entity enters a main state, it immediately rolls one of the component sub-
		 states to engage in. (Also includes some default sub-states like a standing around
		 or wandering state.)
Part 3.) For entity components like inventories, just do flag checks in various functions,
		 so that we just modify possible state behaviors, rather than adding new ones.
