IMPORTANT:
In an effort to ever finish this thing it would probably be best to define some hard limits
on gameplay scope. The game loop should only consist of a single armor slot and a single
weapon slot without a proper inventory that would require me to make an new dedicated UI
screen. Stats should probably also be limited, though maybe there could be certain
consumables that increase them on pickup. No main menu.

TODOS:
Current:
Ranged attacks
   - Implement selection range. Can have a struct that stores info on how far a route is
     allowed to go, penetration, and which traversibility check it should use.
   - Weapon describer should account for range component
   - Allow click to confirm attack selection (might need to do some listener hookups with scene)
   - Add intelligence to ranged damage calculations
   - Magic damage should use 1d2s, and there should be far fewer intelligence mushrooms to
     balance range and ability to damage multiple enemies at once
     - Need to add a value to Damage that specifies dice size


Next:
Add armor
Add more creatures
Slightly better generation
   - Generation for the three floors
   - First rectangles (abandoned complex or inhabited cult), second caves, third something
   - Reduced number of intelligence mushrooms, more powerful items on later floors, healing
     items
Simple gameplay loop
Ability to choose name

Optional:
Add scrolling to PlayerUI and LookUI
Improve player-to-mouse path performance (A* implemenation)
Redo AI
Save functionality (maybe in free time)
   Change terrain tiles to proper entities beforehand if I do do it
Better generation (play around with perlin noise and things)
Look into lua

UI LAYOUT:
Openable (cover whole screen): Full Character Sheet, Inventory, Level Up Dialogues, Settings
Openable (small screen over map view): Use Ability, Take Items

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
MOVEMENT:
Ensure multiple creatures can't occupy same tile on same turn unless one is flying.

Friendly creatures switch places, otherwise a creature gets blocked when trying to move to a
tile where another exists. Probably disallow npcs moving the player character either, only
player character moving npcs. Otherwise high potential for bad gameplay experience.

Maybe eventually include movement cost modifiers.

AI
Necessary:
- Creatures can either be hostile, wary, or passive towards other creatures (including the
  player depending on alignments and threat levels).
- Creatures should retreat when their health percentage is low compared to that of their
  current assailant/would-be victim.
- Creatures should use weapon with highest dps when attacking, potentially modified by a
  'cowardice' stat or something that weights using ranged weapons over melee ones.
- Creatures should be able to use any abilities they have.

Superfluous (maybe add in a later game):
- Have tool-wielding creatures to simulate doing work at workstations, congregate in taverns
  or around campfires in the evening, go to sleep on beds/bedrolls at night.
- Have animals to go to their dens or lairs at different times depending on their circadian
  rhythms.
- Creatures meant to guard things have a chance to fall asleep on the job
- Support for house ownership

MODULAR AI
Part 1.) Have a set of core/basic states, like idle, sleeping, attacking, and fleeing.
Part 2.) Have component states that correspond to core states and have different weights.
		 When an entity enters a main state, it immediately rolls one of the component sub-
		 states to engage in. (Also includes some default sub-states like a standing around
		 or wandering state.)
Part 3.) For entity components like inventories, just do flag checks in various functions,
		 so that we just modify possible state behaviors, rather than adding new ones.
