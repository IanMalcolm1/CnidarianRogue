TODOS:
Current:

Next:
Fix logs and remove all (or most) printf statements
Add player screen
Add game over
Add look functionality
Save functionality
Add better creatures
Implement items properly (ItemManager class necessary)
Implement stats

Optional:
Better generation
Standardize UI screens
Centered text
Look into lua

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
UI LAYOUT:
Openable (cover whole screen): Full Character Sheet, Inventory, Level Up Dialogues, Settings
Openable (small screen over map view): Use Ability, Take Items

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
COMPONENTS:
Renderable component to include all tile location, tile image, and color values?
(don't think we'd need something dedicated to location alone)

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
MOVEMENT:
Include diagonal directions.

Ensure multiple creatures can't occupy same tile on same turn unless one is flying.

Friendly creatures switch places, otherwise a creature gets blocked when trying to move to a
tile where another exists. Probably disallow npcs moving the player character either, only
player character moving npcs. Otherwise high potential for bad gameplay experience.

Maybe eventually include movement cost modifiers.

AI
Necessary:
- Creatures can either be hostile, wary, or passive towards other creatures (including the
  player depending on alignments and threat levels).
- Creatures should retreat when their health percentage is low compared to that of their
  current assailant/would-be victim.
- Creatures should use weapon with highest dps when attacking, potentially modified by a
  'cowardice' stat or something that weights using ranged weapons over melee ones.
- Creatures should be able to use any abilities they have.

Superfluous (maybe add in a later game):
- Have tool-wielding creatures to simulate doing work at workstations, congregate in taverns
  or around campfires in the evening, go to sleep on beds/bedrolls at night.
- Have animals to go to their dens or lairs at different times depending on their circadian
  rhythms.
- Creatures meant to guard things have a chance to fall asleep on the job
- Support for house ownership

MODULAR AI
Part 1.) Have a set of core/basic states, like idle, sleeping, attacking, and fleeing.
Part 2.) Have component states that correspond to core states and have different weights.
		 When an entity enters a main state, it immediately rolls one of the component sub-
		 states to engage in. (Also includes some default sub-states like a standing around
		 or wandering state.)
Part 3.) For entity components like inventories, just do flag checks in various functions,
		 so that we just modify possible state behaviors, rather than adding new ones.
