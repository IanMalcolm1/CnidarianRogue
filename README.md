A small traditional roguelike I made to get some practice with C++ and making non-trivial programs. Uses SDL2 for graphics.

Controls:
- Move N/S/E/W: Arrow Keys
- Move NW/NE/SW/SE: ```y```/```u```/```h```/```j```
- Look: ```l```, or right click on tile
- Wait: ```.```
- Long Wait: ```>``` (```shift```+```.```)
- Pick up item: ```,```
- Use Stairs: ```<``` (```shift```+```,```)
- Heal: ```f```
- Target: ```t```
- Shoot: Click tile or hit ```enter``` while in target mode


Most UI elements can be zoomed in/out by scrolling while depressing the ctrl key.
