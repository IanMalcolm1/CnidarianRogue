A short traditional roguelike I made to get some practice with C++ and making non--trivial programs. Uses SDL2 for graphics.

Controls:
- Heal: f
- Target: t (click or hit enter to shoot)
- Wait: .
- Long Wait: > (shift+.)
- Pick up: ,
- Use Stairs: < (shift+,)
- Move N/S/E/W: Arrow Keys
- Move NW/NE/SW/SE: y/u/h/j
